Description: This package provides an R interface to Megadepth by Christopher
    Wilks available at (<https://github.com/ChristopherWilks/megadepth>). It is
    particularly useful for computing the coverage of a set of genomic regions
    across bigWig or BAM files. With this package, you can build base-pair
    coverage matrices for regions or annotations of your choice from BigWig
    files. Megadepth was used to create the raw files provided by
    <https://bioconductor.org/packages/recount3>.
