The goal of `megadepth` is to provide an R interface to the command line
tool [megadepth](https://github.com/ChristopherWilks/megadepth) for
BigWig and BAM related utilities created by [Christopher
Wilks](https://twitter.com/chrisnwilks). This R package enables fast
processing of bigWig files on downstream packages such as
[dasper](https://bioconductor.org/packages/dasper) and
[recount3](https://bioconductor.org/packages/recount3).

## Installation instructions

Get the latest stable `R` release from
[CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/). Then install `megadepth` using from
[Bioconductor](http://bioconductor.org/) the following code:

``` r
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE)) {
    install.packages("BiocManager")
}

BiocManager::install("megadepth")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
BiocManager::install("LieberInstitute/megadepth")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library("megadepth")
## basic example code
```
