The goal of `megadepth` is to provide an R interface to the command line
tool [Megadepth](https://github.com/ChristopherWilks/megadepth) for
BigWig and BAM related utilities created by [Christopher
Wilks](https://twitter.com/chrisnwilks). This R package enables **fast**
processing of BigWig files on downstream packages such as
[dasper](https://bioconductor.org/packages/dasper) and
[recount3](https://bioconductor.org/packages/recount3). The
[Megadepth](https://github.com/ChristopherWilks/megadepth) software also
provides utilities for processing BAM files and extracting coverage
information from them.

Here is an illustration on how fast `megadepth` is compared to other
tools for processing local and remote BigWig files.

Throughout the documentation we use a capital `M` to refer to the
software by Christopher Wilks and a lower case `m` to refer to this
R/Bioconductor package.

## Installation instructions

Get the latest stable `R` release from
[CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/). Then install `megadepth` using from
[Bioconductor](http://bioconductor.org/) the following code:

``` r
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE)) {
    install.packages("BiocManager")
}

BiocManager::install("megadepth")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
BiocManager::install("LieberInstitute/megadepth")
```

## Example

In the following example, we install
[Megadepth](https://github.com/ChristopherWilks/megadepth) with
`install_megadepth()`, which downloads a binary for your OS (Linux,
Windows or macOS). We can then use with an example BigWig file to
compute the coverage at a set of regions.

``` r
## Load the R package
library("megadepth")

## Install Megadepth's pre-compiled binary on your system
install_megadepth()
#> It seems megadepth has been installed. Use force = TRUE to reinstall or upgrade.

## Next, we locate the example BigWig and annotation files
example_bw <- system.file("tests", "test.bam.all.bw",
    package = "megadepth", mustWork = TRUE
)
annotation_file <- system.file("tests", "testbw2.bed",
    package = "megadepth", mustWork = TRUE
)

## We can then use megadepth to compute the coverage
bw_cov <- get_coverage(example_bw, op = "mean", annotation = annotation_file)
bw_cov
#> GRanges object with 4 ranges and 1 metadata column:
#>         seqnames          ranges strand |     score
#>            <Rle>       <IRanges>  <Rle> | <numeric>
#>   [1]      chr10            0-10      * |     0.000
#>   [2]      chr10 8756697-8756762      * |    15.846
#>   [3]      chr10 4359156-4359188      * |     3.000
#>   [4] GL000219.1   168500-168620      * |     1.258
#>   -------
#>   seqinfo: 2 sequences from an unspecified genome; no seqlengths
```

## Full set of utilities

[Megadepth](https://github.com/ChristopherWilks/megadepth) is very
powerful and can do a lot of different things. The R/Bioconductor
package provides two functions for interfacing with
[Megadepth](https://github.com/ChristopherWilks/megadepth),
`megadepth_cmd()` and `megadepth_shell()`. For the first one,
`megadepth_cmd()`, you need to know the actual command syntax you want
to use and format it accordingly. If you are more comfortable with R
functions, `megadepth_shell()` uses
*[cmdfun](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=cmdfun)* to power this
interface and capture the standard output stream into R.

To make it easier to use, `megadepth` includes functions that simplify
the number of arguments, read in the output files, and converts them
into R/Bioconductor friendly objects, such as `get_coverage()`
illustrated above.

We hope that youâ€™ll find `megadepth` and
[Megadepth](https://github.com/ChristopherWilks/megadepth) useful for
your work. If you are interested in checking how **fast** `megadepth`
is, check out the [**speed
analysis**](https://github.com/LieberInstitute/megadepth/tree/master/analysis)
comparison against other tools. Note that the size of the files used and
the number of genomic regions queried will affect the speed comparisons.

``` r

    #> megadepth 1.0.4
    #>  
    #>  BAM and BigWig utility.
    #>  
    #>  Usage:
    #>    megadepth <bam|bw|-> [options]
    #>  
    #>  Options:
    #>    -h --help                Show this screen.
    #>    --version                Show version.
    #>    --threads                # of threads to do: BAM decompression OR compute sums over multiple BigWigs in parallel
    #>                              if the 2nd is intended then a TXT file listing the paths to the BigWigs to process in parallel
    #>                              should be passed in as the main input file instead of a single BigWig file (EXPERIMENTAL).
    #>    --prefix                 String to use to prefix all output files.
    #>    --no-annotation-stdout   Force summarized annotation regions to be written to <prefix>.annotation.tsv rather than STDOUT
    #>    --no-coverage-stdout     Force covered regions to be written to <prefix>.coverage.tsv rather than STDOUT
    #>    --keep-order             Output annotation coverage in the order chromosomes appear in the BAM/BigWig file
    #>                             The default is to output annotation coverage in the order chromosomes appear in the annotation BED file.
    #>                             This is only applicable if --annotation is used for either BAM or BigWig input.
    #>  
    #>  BigWig Input:
    #>  Extract regions and their counts from a BigWig outputting BED format if a BigWig file is detected as input (exclusive of the other BAM modes):
    #>                                            Extracts all reads from the passed in BigWig and output as BED format.
    #>                                             This will also report the AUC over the annotated regions to STDOUT.
    #>                                             If only the name of the BigWig file is passed in with no other args, it will *only* report total AUC to STDOUT.
    #>    --annotation <bed>                      Only output the regions in this BED applying the argument to --op to them.
    #>    --op <sum[default], mean, min, max>     Statistic to run on the intervals provided by --annotation
    #>    --sums-only                             Discard coordinates from output of summarized regions
    #>    --bwbuffer <1GB[default]>               Size of buffer for reading BigWig files, critical to use a large value (~1GB) for remote BigWigs.
    #>                                             Default setting should be fine for most uses, but raise if very slow on a remote BigWig.
    #>  
    #>  
    #>  BAM Input:
    #>  Extract basic junction information from the BAM, including co-occurrence
    #>    --junctions          Extract jx coordinates, strand, and anchor length, per read
    #>                         writes to a TSV file <prefix>.jxs.tsv
    #>    --longreads          Modifies certain buffer sizes to accommodate longer reads such as PB/Oxford.
    #>

    #>                                 Writes to a CSV file <prefix>.alts.tsv
    #>    --include-softclip           Print a record to the alts CSV for soft-clipped bases
    #>                                 Writes total counts to a separate TSV file <prefix>.softclip.tsv
    #>    --only-polya                 If --include-softclip, only print softclips which are mostly A's or T's
    #>    --include-n                  Print mismatch records when mismatched read base is N
    #>    --print-qual                 Print quality values for mismatched bases

    #>                         and for the annotation if --annotation is also passed in
    #>                         Writes to a TSV file <prefix>.auc.tsv
    #>    --bigwig             Output coverage as BigWig file(s).  Writes to <prefix>.bw
    #>                         (also <prefix>.unique.bw when --min-unique-qual is specified).
    #>                         Requires libBigWig.
    #>    --annotation <bed>   Path to BED file containing list of regions to sum coverage over

    #>  
    #>  Other outputs:

    #>                         then only the alignments that pass that filter will be counted here
    #>                         Writes to 2 TSV files: <prefix>.starts.tsv, <prefix>.ends.tsv
