This R package depends on (<https://github.com/ChristopherWilks/megadepth>) by
Christopher Wilks. Christopher distributes pre-compiled binaries for macOS,
Windows, and linux. Thus, the easiest way to install this software is to
acces the "releases" section on GitHub at
(<https://github.com/ChristopherWilks/megadepth/releases>) and download the
version for your operating system. You then need to make megadepth available on
the `PATH` environment variable. Below are the steps for installing megadepth
on a macOS computer. However, if you need to build megadepth from scratch,
check the instructions at
(<https://github.com/ChristopherWilks/megadepth#building>).

## Where you want to install megadepth
cd ~/software

## Create a directory for it
mkdir megadepth
cd megadepth

## Download the binary (here, it's version 1.0.4 for macOS)
wget https://github.com/ChristopherWilks/megadepth/releases/download/1.0.4/megadepth_macos

## Rename the megadepth_macos executable to megadepth
mv megadepth* megadepth

## Provide execute permissions
chmod u+x megadepth*

## Add it to your PATH
## You might want to add this to your ~/.bashrc file
export PATH=~/software/megadepth:$PATH

## Test that you can find the executable on a new terminal window
which megadepth
