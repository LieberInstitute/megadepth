This R package depends on (<https://github.com/ChristopherWilks/megadepth>) by
Christopher Wilks. Christopher distributes pre-compiled binaries for macOS,
Windows, and linux. Thus, the easiest way to install this software is to
access the "releases" section on GitHub at
(<https://github.com/ChristopherWilks/megadepth/releases>) and download the
version for your operating system to a directory already on your PATH. To
facilitate this, we have provided the function megadepth::install_megadepth().
However, if you need to build Megadepth from scratch, check the instructions at
(<https://github.com/ChristopherWilks/megadepth#building>).
